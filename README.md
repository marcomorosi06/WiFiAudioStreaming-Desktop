## ‚ú® Key Features  
* **Server & Client Modes**: Use the app to **send** (Server) or **receive** (Client) audio.  
* **Automatic Discovery**: Clients on the local network automatically find available servers, with no need for manual IP address entry.  
* **Unicast & Multicast Support**: Choose between direct streaming to a single device (Unicast) or simultaneous transmission to multiple clients (Multicast), ideal for multi-room audio.  
* **Detailed Audio Configuration**: Customize your audio experience with options for sample rate, bit depth, channels (mono/stereo), and buffer size.  
* **Modern Interface**: The interface, developed with **Jetpack Compose for Desktop**, is clean and easy to use.  
* **Multi-Server Support**: You can use multiple servers on the same network by changing the **connection port** in the settings. Make sure the port is configured identically on both the client and the server.
